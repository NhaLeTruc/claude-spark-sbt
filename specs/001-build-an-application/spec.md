# Feature Specification: Spark-Based ETL Pipeline Framework

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help me extracts, transforms, loads data from and to sources or sinks like kafka, postgres, mysql, and amazon S3. All code must be unit tested and integration tested. Any test data must be mocked - you do not need to pull anything from any real sources. The application must process these qualities:
1. The core codebase must follow the "Strategy" design pattern. Common interfaces must be defined for all concrete implementations, declaring the method(s) that the concrete implementations will execute.
2. The core codebase must be clean and follow the "SOLID" principles.
3. The core codebase must be built around a "pipeline" object for creating customizable pipeline implementations. Following the strategy design pattern, "pipeline" must has its own interface with a "run" function for the pipeline's instantiation.
4. Each "pipeline" composes multiple functional steps of extracts, transforms, and loads. You must build these functional steps modules strictly following the functional programming paradigm.
5. These pipeline objects must be built so that they can be individually submitted to spark cluster's spark-submit tool for execution.
6. Data format between pipeline stages must be avro. Data schemas for validation must be stored in JSON and organized separately in a dedicated module.
7. Configurations classes must be written in Scala. Customizable config variables must be stored in JSON format and organized separately in a dedicated module.
8. Functional transformations types are aggregations, joins, and windowing. You only need to write one transformation function per type for testing purposes. Structure the transformation module for easy expansion later.
9. Write modes must provide options such as append, overwrite, and upsert for user to specify in each loads function.
10. Execution models includes batch utilizes Spark, and streaming utilizes Spark Streaming.
11. Metrics exposure must be logs only.
12. Expected batch throughput/data volume targets are 100K records/sec (simple), 10K records/sec (complex). And for streaming is 5s p95 latency, 50K events/sec throughput.
13. Each pipeline must be retried at most 3 times after a delay of 5 seconds.
14. Credential must be stored in a simple vault solution which can be tested locally."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a data engineer, I need to build and execute data pipelines that move data between different systems (Kafka, PostgreSQL, MySQL, S3), apply transformations (aggregations, joins, windowing), and load results to target destinations. I need the system to handle both batch and streaming workloads, automatically retry on failures, validate data quality, and provide visibility through logs. The pipelines must be composable, testable, and deployable to Spark clusters.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have source data in Kafka, **When** I configure a streaming pipeline to extract, aggregate by key, and load to PostgreSQL with append mode, **Then** the system processes events with p95 latency under 5 seconds and throughput of at least 50K events/second

2. **Given** I have CSV files in S3, **When** I configure a batch pipeline to extract, join with reference data from MySQL, and load to another S3 location with overwrite mode, **Then** the system processes at least 10K records/second for this complex transformation

3. **Given** a pipeline execution fails due to transient network error, **When** the failure occurs, **Then** the system automatically retries up to 3 times with 5-second delays between attempts

4. **Given** I configure multiple extract sources (Kafka + PostgreSQL), **When** I execute the pipeline, **Then** data flows through Avro format between stages and schemas are validated against JSON schema definitions

5. **Given** I need to deploy a pipeline to production, **When** I package the pipeline, **Then** it can be submitted to Spark cluster using spark-submit without modification

6. **Given** extracted data violates schema constraints, **When** validation runs, **Then** the pipeline halts execution, logs the validation failure with record details, and does not proceed to transform/load stages

### Edge Cases

- What happens when source system is temporarily unavailable during extraction?
  - System retries up to 3 times with 5-second delays, logs each attempt, and fails pipeline if all retries exhausted

- How does system handle schema evolution (new fields added to source)?
  - Schema validation detects mismatch, halts pipeline, logs schema incompatibility with details for manual resolution

- What happens when target system rejects upsert due to constraint violation?
  - Failed records logged to dead letter queue (logs), pipeline continues processing remaining records, final status reports partial failure

- How does system handle very large aggregation windows in streaming mode?
  - System applies backpressure, logs resource warnings, and gracefully degrades throughput while maintaining correctness

- What happens when credentials are invalid or expired?
  - Credential vault returns error on first access attempt, pipeline fails immediately with clear authentication error message

- How does system handle duplicate records in batch extraction?
  - Deduplication not automatic; transformation functions can implement deduplication logic if needed, otherwise duplicates pass through
